variable naming:
wondering if "_start" should be "_launch", "_open", "_opening", "_kickoff", "_outset", "_startoff", "_alpha"
wondering if "_end" should be "_finish", "_ending", "_close", "_closing", "_landing", "_wrapup"
also wondering what "runway" should be, perhaps just "run", "track", "sprint", "strip", "middle", "center", etc.?
remember: choose variable names with the same care as naming a child.\n
The field "current_piece" could have values "WHITE", "BLACK", or null.
