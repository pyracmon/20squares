The Royal Game of Ur
--------------------

The Roayal Game of Ur is an ancient board game. This is a repo (in progress) with the server and client code for running an in-broswer version of this game.

Currently, it only runs locally as a python script from your command line. The only dependency is Python 2.

Run
```
python play.py
```
to start the game!
