The Royal Game of Ur
--------------------

The Roayal Game of Ur is an ancient board game. This is a repo (in progress) with the server and client code for running an in-broswer version of this game.

Currently, it only runs locally as a python script from your command line. The only dependency is Python 2.

Run
```
python play.py
```
to start the game!

Board Indexing
--------------
Below is a picture representing the index encoding of each square that we have chosen to use. The bottom of the board is white's side and the top is black's. There are also indexes "0" and "21" (not shown here) which represent the two offboard positions, with "0" being where pieces begin and "21" being where pieces finish.
